KANI is a close cousin of KAME, another quadruped robot that we can discover here :  https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1265766
 A big thank-you at bbq3D (https://www.thingiverse.com/bq3D/about) for his project and his inspiration.

But, KANI project is characterized by some interesting notes :

--> All the parts have been completely redesigned to facilitate 3D printing :
in PLA,

- without support structure,
- without adhesion border

--> The source files are available in the format :
- f3d  (Autodesk Fusion360)
- obj (3D format for import/export)
- stl (for 3D printing)

--> Any screws aren't needed for mounting articulation

--> The robot is designed around a ESP8266 and 8 servo motors type MG90S, in metal, robust and cheap

--> The set is powered by 2 batteries NCR18650B 3,7V 3400mAh and a 5V UBEC regulator

Update Sep. 2022 : BIG KANI - new version with MG996 servo
